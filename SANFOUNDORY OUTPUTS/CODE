Let's break down the issue with the code step-by-step:

The C code in question is:

#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    1 < 2 ? return 1 : return 2;
}

1. Ternary Conditional Operator:

The ternary conditional operator in C is used for conditional expressions. It follows this structure:

condition ? expression1 : expression2;

If condition is true, it evaluates and returns expression1.

If condition is false, it evaluates and returns expression2.


In your case, the condition is 1 < 2, which is true. So, the ternary operator will attempt to execute return 1 (since 1 < 2 is true).

2. Issue with return Inside the Ternary Operator:

The problem arises because the ternary operator expects expressions on both sides (before and after the colon :). However, return is a statement, not an expression. In C, a statement (like return) cannot be used as part of an expression (like those in a ternary operator).

A statement is something that performs an action (such as return, printf, etc.), while an expression is something that produces a value.

3. What Happens in Your Code:

In this code:

1 < 2 ? return 1 : return 2;

1 < 2 evaluates to true, so it tries to execute return 1.

However, return 1 is a statement, not an expression. The ternary operator is expecting an expression, so the use of return inside the ternary operator causes a compile-time error.


4. Conclusion:

In summary, the C compiler will throw an error because the ternary operator is being misused with return, which is a statement and not an expression.

Correct Version:

If you want to use a conditional statement with return, you should avoid using the ternary operator. Instead, use a regular if-else statement:

#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    if (1 < 2)
        return 1;
    else
        return 2;
}

This version is valid because the return statements are used as part of control flow, not inside the ternary operator.

Final Answer:

d) Compile time error
