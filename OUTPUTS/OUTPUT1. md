Let's walk through the code:

Code Explanation:

1. int n;: Declares an integer variable n.


2. for(n = 7; n != 0; n--): This loop initializes n to 7 and decrements it (n--) each iteration, continuing as long as n is not equal to 0.


3. printf("n = %d", n--);: Inside the loop, n is printed and then decremented again within the printf statement.

So in each iteration, n will be decremented twice: once inside the loop condition and once in the printf function.



4. getchar();: This waits for the user to press a key before the program exits.


5. return 0;: The program ends successfully.



Step-by-Step Execution:

Initially, n = 7.

The loop will print the value of n and decrement it by 2 because of the double decrement (n-- inside the loop and inside printf).

Let's see what happens in each iteration:


Output:

n = 7n = 5n = 3n = 1

The loop terminates when n becomes 0.

Key Observations:

The value of n is decremented twice in each loop iteration.

The program prints 7, 5, 3, and 1 before the loop stops.
