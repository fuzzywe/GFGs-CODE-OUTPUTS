```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	static int i=5;
	if(--i){
		main();
		printf("%d ",i);
	} 
}
```

Let me explain it even more clearly with a detailed visual step-by-step walkthrough, showing the call stack, the value of `i` at each step, and how the recursive calls are made and unwound.

### Initial Understanding:
- The program uses **recursion** to call the `main()` function multiple times.
- **Static Variable `i`** retains its value across all function calls, which is critical to understand the output.
- The variable `i` starts with the value `5`, and it's decremented in each call until it reaches `0`.

---

### Initial Setup:
```c
int main() {
    static int i = 5;  // Step 1: 'i' is initialized to 5 (once due to 'static').
    if (--i) {         // Step 2: Decrement 'i' by 1, then check if 'i' is non-zero.
        main();        // Step 3: Recursively call 'main()' if 'i' is non-zero.
        printf("%d ", i);  // Step 4: Print the value of 'i'.
    }
}
```

---

### **Step-by-Step Execution**:

1. **First Call to `main()`** (Initial `i = 5`):
   - `static int i = 5;` → This is the first time `i` is initialized. 
   - `--i;` → `i` is decremented from `5` to `4`.
   - Since `i = 4` (non-zero), the program **calls `main()` recursively**.

   **Call Stack**:
   ```
   main() [i = 4]
   ```

---

2. **Second Call to `main()`** (Now `i = 4`):
   - `static int i;` → `i` remains `4` from the first call because it's static.
   - `--i;` → `i` is decremented from `4` to `3`.
   - Since `i = 3` (non-zero), the program **calls `main()` recursively** again.

   **Call Stack**:
   ```
   main() [i = 3]  <--- Second call
   main() [i = 4]  <--- First call
   ```

---

3. **Third Call to `main()`** (Now `i = 3`):
   - `static int i;` → `i` remains `3`.
   - `--i;` → `i` is decremented from `3` to `2`.
   - Since `i = 2` (non-zero), the program **calls `main()` recursively** again.

   **Call Stack**:
   ```
   main() [i = 2]  <--- Third call
   main() [i = 3]  <--- Second call
   main() [i = 4]  <--- First call
   ```

---

4. **Fourth Call to `main()`** (Now `i = 2`):
   - `static int i;` → `i` remains `2`.
   - `--i;` → `i` is decremented from `2` to `1`.
   - Since `i = 1` (non-zero), the program **calls `main()` recursively** again.

   **Call Stack**:
   ```
   main() [i = 1]  <--- Fourth call
   main() [i = 2]  <--- Third call
   main() [i = 3]  <--- Second call
   main() [i = 4]  <--- First call
   ```

---

5. **Fifth Call to `main()`** (Now `i = 1`):
   - `static int i;` → `i` remains `1`.
   - `--i;` → `i` is decremented from `1` to `0`.
   - Since `i = 0`, the condition `if (--i)` becomes `false`, so the program does **not** call `main()` again.
   - No recursive call happens, and the recursion stops here.

   **Call Stack**:
   ```
   main() [i = 0]  <--- Fifth call (no more recursion)
   main() [i = 1]  <--- Fourth call
   main() [i = 2]  <--- Third call
   main() [i = 3]  <--- Second call
   main() [i = 4]  <--- First call
   ```

---

### **Recursion Stops – Now Unwinding Begins**:
At this point, the recursion has stopped. Now, the program will **unwind** the recursive calls, printing the value of `i` in **reverse order**.

1. **Fifth Call Unwinds (i = 0)**:
   - After recursion stops, the `printf("%d ", i);` statement in the fifth call executes.
   - `i = 0` (since `i` was decremented to `0` in the last step).
   - The program prints:
     ```
     0
     ```

   **Call Stack** (after printing):
   ```
   main() [i = 1]  <--- Fourth call
   main() [i = 2]  <--- Third call
   main() [i = 3]  <--- Second call
   main() [i = 4]  <--- First call
   ```

---

2. **Fourth Call Unwinds (i = 0)**:
   - Control returns to the fourth call, where `i` was `1` before the recursion.
   - Now, `i = 0` (since `i` is static and retains its value from the previous call).
   - The program prints:
     ```
     0
     ```

   **Call Stack** (after printing):
   ```
   main() [i = 2]  <--- Third call
   main() [i = 3]  <--- Second call
   main() [i = 4]  <--- First call
   ```

---

3. **Third Call Unwinds (i = 0)**:
   - Control returns to the third call, where `i` was `2` before the recursion.
   - Now, `i = 0`.
   - The program prints:
     ```
     0
     ```

   **Call Stack** (after printing):
   ```
   main() [i = 3]  <--- Second call
   main() [i = 4]  <--- First call
   ```

---

4. **Second Call Unwinds (i = 0)**:
   - Control returns to the second call, where `i` was `3` before the recursion.
   - Now, `i = 0`.
   - The program prints:
     ```
     0
     ```

   **Call Stack** (after printing):
   ```
   main() [i = 4]  <--- First call
   ```

---

5. **First Call Unwinds (i = 0)**:
   - Control returns to the first call, where `i` was `4` before the recursion.
   - Now, `i = 0`.
   - The program prints:
     ```
     0
     ```

---

### **Final Output**:
After all recursive calls unwind, the final output is:
```
0 0 0 0
```

### Key Points:
- The variable `i` is **static**, so it retains its value across recursive calls.
- After recursion stops at `i = 0`, all previous recursive calls print `0` during the unwinding process because `i` remains `0`.
- Each function call prints the value of `i` after it finishes the recursion, which explains why we see four `0`s in the output.
